# Python Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

A bit of practice in python data structures and algorithms using: "A First Course on Data Structures in Python" by Donald Sheehy, "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava, and Runestone Interactive's "Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python" course by Brad Miller and David Ranum.

**Required languages**: Python 

# What I Learned

* Basic Data Structures
* Also Algorithms
* The word "grokk". 
* Jupyter lab utility. 
* Notes in Python.
